# Vehicle-Showcase-AR-app

 The aim of this project is to develop AR vehicle showcase android app using Unity 3D and Vuforia. A voice controlled cloud based machine learning AI bot is integrated with wit.ai API. This app will project 3D model of vehicle in the real world which makes the user to experience the view of real car showcase. Then by using our voice commands, the integrated bot will react to perform particular operation like open the car doors, change the colours, start the engine.
